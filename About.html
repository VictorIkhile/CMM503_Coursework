                    <li>
                        <p>In some modules, you are required to take part in a group  project. In these instances, it is necessary for all group members to work  together to complete a project. It is expected that all members will work with  the same level of commitment and enthusiasm. However, this does not always  occur and as such, peer assessment of individuals within group tasks is an  important aspect. There is an opportunity for a web application to be created  that could aid in this. In this system, there are the following types of users.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Administrators</li>
                    <li>Students</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Accompanying this, the following basic functionality should  be implemented.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Administrators should login to the system to  gain access</li>
                    <li>Administrators should be able to set up a coursework  item and then should be able to split students into groups for the coursework.</li>
                    <li>Students should enter the system through a  personalized link and can then give feedback on how they worked in a group.</li>
                    <li>Students should be able to upload files to supplement  their feedback.</li>
                    <li>Students should not see the feedback from other  students.</li>
                    <li>Administrators should be able to see a detailed  report for each group showing how students worked together.</li>
                </ul>
